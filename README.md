# Fish-Hunter
In this Java game, players take control of a little black fish that must grow by consuming other fish that are the same size or smaller. The objective is to avoid being eaten by bigger fish while becoming the largest fish in the sea. To control the fish, players can drag the mouse to set a destination for the fish to swim towards. As the little fish grows in size, it becomes easier to consume smaller fish, but also attracts the attention of larger predators. Players must balance the risk of going after bigger prey with the danger of being caught by a larger fish.
